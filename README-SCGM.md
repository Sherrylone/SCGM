# SCGM

This repo provides code for 'Self-supervised Learning of Visual Graph Matching' based on ThinkMatch.
We implement SCGM with some modification on the original ThinkMatch code.
We provide two configs ``vgg16_bbgm_voc_cl.yaml`` and ``vgg16_ngmv2_voc_cl.yaml`` for running SCGM with the backbone model BBGM and NGMv2.
