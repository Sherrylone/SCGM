Welcome to ThinkMatch's documentation!
======================================

**ThinkMatch** is a deep graph matching repository developed and maintained by
`ThinkLab <http://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn>`_ at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

This repository is developed for the following purposes:

* **Providing modules** for developing deep graph matching algorithms to facilitate future research.
* **Providing implementation** of state-of-the-art deep graph matching methods.
* **Benchmarking** existing deep graph matching algorithms under different dataset & experiment settings, for the purpose of fair comparison.
