# SCGM

This is the official implementation of our ECCV 2022 paper 'Self-supervised Learning of Visual Graph Matching' based on [ThinkMatch](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/ThinkMatch).
We implement SCGM with some modification on the original ThinkMatch code.

Now, we provide two configs ``vgg16_bbgm_voc_cl.yaml`` and ``vgg16_ngmv2_voc_cl.yaml`` for running SCGM with the backbone model BBGM and NGMv2.
